# Sticky Notes

Sticky notes are small, versatile tools used for capturing quick ideas, reminders, or tasks. Available in physical (paper) or digital formats, they help organize thoughts, prioritize work, and enhance productivity. Physical sticky notes are adhesive and can be placed on surfaces like desks or walls for visibility. Digital sticky notes, found in apps or computer systems, offer features like color-coding, syncing, and search functionality. They are widely used in workplaces, homes, and educational settings for brainstorming, collaboration, or planning. With their simplicity and accessibility, sticky notes are a practical solution for managing information and staying organized in daily life.
